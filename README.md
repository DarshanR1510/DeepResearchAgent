<h2>🧠 AI Deep Research Agent</h2>

<p>This repository contains an intelligent AI-powered agent capable of generating <strong>in-depth, structured reports</strong> on any given topic. Simply provide a subject of interest, and if required, the agent will ask you few questions for better clarifications, and then the agent will research it comprehensively and deliver a detailed report straight to your <strong>email inbox</strong> and display it in the web UI.</p>

<h3>✨ Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>🔍 Accepts any topic as input</li>
  <li>🤔 Asks clarifying questions to refine the research</li>
  <li>🧩 Plans and executes multiple web searches for comprehensive coverage</li>
  <li>📄 Generates detailed, well-organized reports with clear sections</li>
  <li>📧 Sends the report directly to the specified email address and shows it in the UI</li>
  <li>🗂️ Provides links to relevant sources and further reading</li>
  <li>⚡ Fast, efficient, and fully automated</li>
</ul>

<h3>🚦 How It Works</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Topic Input:</strong> Enter your research topic in the web interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Clarification:</strong> The agent asks up to 3 clarifying questions to better understand your needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Planning:</strong> The agent generates 3 focused web search queries with reasons for each.</li>
  <li><strong>Research:</strong> Each query is used to perform a web search and generate a summary.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Summaries are evaluated for quality and relevance; low-quality results are retried up to 3 times.</li>
  <li><strong>Report Writing:</strong> The best summaries are compiled into a structured, detailed report.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> The report is emailed to you and displayed in the Gradio UI.</li>
</ol>
